      <p className="first-para MainPage-para">Currently working in Cisco as a senior software engineer, with 7 years of professional work experience in USA and 1 year of start-up experience in India.</p>
      <p className="second-para MainPage-para">I have experience working in multiple team setups from startups to big corporates. Wearing different hats of front-end developer, back-end
      developer and Devops developer, I have gained a wealth of knowledge in software engineering. I have been fortunate to work and mentor with some great minds which taught me clean coding practices. I have special experience in building tools from concept stage to production as well as contributing to architecture design discussions and code reviews for the team.</p>
      <p className="third-para MainPage-para">
      I am excited about my next opportunity that focuses on end-to-end ownership which is a major driving force for me. I like to learn new technologies which is why I ventured into Devops after being a front end engineer. I am excited to take up new challenges in my next job and that aligns with this opportunity, which deals with fast paced development. Please feel free to reach out for fun collaborations, projects or job opportunities.
